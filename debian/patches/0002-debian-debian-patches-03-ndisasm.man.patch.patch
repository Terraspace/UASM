+
+DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
+       The nnddiissaassmm command generates a disassembly listing of the binary  file
+       _i_n_f_i_l_e and directs it to stdout.
+
+   OOPPTTIIOONNSS
+       --hh     Causes  nnddiissaassmm  to  exit immediately, after giving a summary of
+              its invocation options.
+
+       --rr     Causes nnddiissaassmm to exit immediately, after displaying its version
+              number.
+
+       --oo _o_r_i_g_i_n
+              Specifies  the  notional  load address for the file. This option
+              causes nnddiissaassmm to get the addresses it lists down the left  hand
+              margin, and the target addresses of PC‐relative jumps and calls,
+              right.
+
+       --ss _s_y_n_c_‐_p_o_i_n_t
+              Manually specifies a synchronisation address, such that  nnddiissaassmm
+              will  not output any machine instruction which encompasses bytes
+              on both sides of the address. Hence the instruction which _s_t_a_r_t_s
+              at that address will be correctly disassembled.
+
+       --ee _h_d_r_l_e_n
+              Specifies a number of bytes to discard from the beginning of the
+              file before starting disassembly. This does  not  count  towards
+              the  calculation  of the disassembly offset: the first _d_i_s_a_s_s_e_m_‐
+              _b_l_e_d instruction will  be  shown  starting  at  the  given  load
+              address.
+
+       --kk _o_f_f_s_e_t_,_l_e_n_g_t_h
+              Specifies  that  _l_e_n_g_t_h  bytes, starting from disassembly offset
+              _o_f_f_s_e_t, should be skipped over without  generating  any  output.
+              The  skipped  bytes  still  count towards the calculation of the
+              disassembly offset.
+
+       --aa or --ii
+              Enables automatic (or intelligent) sync mode, in  which  nnddiissaassmm
+              will attempt to guess where synchronisation should be performed,
+              by means of examining the target addresses of the relative jumps
+              and calls it disassembles.
+
+       --bb _b_i_t_s
+              Specifies  either  16‐bit  or 32‐bit mode. The default is 16‐bit
+              mode.
+
+       --uu     Specifies 32‐bit mode, more compactly than using ‘‐b 32’.
+
+       --pp _v_e_n_d_o_r
+              Prefers instructions as defined by _v_e_n_d_o_r in case of a conflict.
+              Known  _v_e_n_d_o_r  names  include  iinntteell,  aammdd, ccyyrriixx, and iiddtt.  The
+              default is iinntteell.
+
+
+RREESSTTRRIICCTTIIOONNSS
+       nnddiissaassmm only disassembles binary files: it has no understanding of  the
+       header  information  present in object or executable files. If you want
+       to disassemble an object file, you should probably be using oobbjjdduummpp(11).
+
+       Auto‐sync  mode  won’t  necessarily cure all your synchronisation prob‐
+       lems: a sync marker can only be placed automatically if a jump or  call
+       instruction  is  found to refer to it _b_e_f_o_r_e nnddiissaassmm actually disassem‐
+       bles that part of the code. Also, if spurious  jumps  or  calls  result
+       from  disassembling  non‐machine‐code data, sync markers may get placed
+       in strange places. Feel free to turn auto‐sync off and go back to doing
+       it manually if necessary.
+
+       nnddiissaassmm  can  only  keep track of 8192 sync markers internally at once:
+       this is to do with portability, since DOS machines don’t take kindly to
+       more than 64K being allocated at a time.
