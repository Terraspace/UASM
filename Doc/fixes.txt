  Issues in the source which should be fixed.

  1. Backpatching

  Currently backpatching handles JMPs and CALLs only. It
  is unable to handle PUSHs ( and may be others as well).
  So the backpatch routine calculates addresses wrong and
  as a result an additional assembly pass is required.

  2. Two Pass Minimum

  Currently the generated code/data bytes aren't stored in
  assembly pass one. So a second pass is always needed. 
  With better backpatching capabilities, JWasm should be
  able to virtually become a one-pass assembler.

[ issue fixed in v2.06

  3. Token Buffer

  The token buffer is a global variable. This causes
  a lot of problems. There are some workarounds implemented
  to make the buffer reusable, but these hacks didn't
  help to make the code more readable.
