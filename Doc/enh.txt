  Possible Enhancements for JWasm

  1. support UNICODE strings. Similar to PoAsm? Most likely no,
     since using the DB/DW directives to define such strings 
     doesn't seem to be the best strategy. Might be better to 
     have an extra type for unicode strings (tchar), in 
     conjunction with a cmdline option to switch ansi/unicode.

  2. [ done, was: option FPO (frame pointer omission); has
     become option STACKBASE. ]

  3. unnamed RECORD within a STRUCT. Record field names
     will be local then and must be unique within the STRUCT. This
     feature will ease converting C include files to ASM.

     Syntax:

     operator WIDTH: ok
     operator MASK: ???

     S1 STRUCT
     f1  dd ?
     RECORD bit0:1, bit1:1
     S1  ends

     mov eax, MASK S1.bit0
     or v1.bit0 ???

  4. [ done, was: native support for PE binaries ]

  5. ASSUME extension

     use ASSUME CS:[USE16|USE32|USE64] to change current offset size
     without changing segments.

  6. FOR extension

     Preprocessor extension:

     FOR EACH x IN [<struct>|<union>|<record>|<proc>]
       ...
     ENDM

     - x is the loop variable, it's a text macro, its value will be
       the name of the item.
     - the "members" are enumerated. For PROCedures, these are the
       parameters, local variables and local labels.
